# Understanding API Integration

An API (Application Programming Interface) allows us to communicate with an external service to retrieve data.
Public APIs like OpenWeatherMap provide data that we can use in applications.

# How It Works:
Make a request to the API using the requests library.
Receive JSON data from the API.
Extract relevant information from the response.
Visualize the data using matplotlib or seaborn.

# Installing Required Libraries
We need the following Python libraries:

requests → To fetch data from an API.
matplotlib → For basic data visualization.
seaborn → For more advanced, stylish visualizations.
# Conclusion 
Fetched real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
Extracted key weather parameters (temperature, humidity, pressure).
Visualized data using both Matplotlib and Seaborn.
